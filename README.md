# Selected SICP Solutions

This repository contains selected solutions from the classic book **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)**.

## 📘 Contents

- `SICP_question_and_aswers.rkt`: Racket code with selected answers and questions.

- ## Notes
- * I chose to upload the questions and answers as a single file: in which questions are commented and answers are given right below it(Because i thought it'll be better in that way).
  * I added additional comments that help to think more clearly(for instance some egs: are converted to more familiar language like python to understand the concepts better).

## 🧠 About

SICP helped me explore key computer science concepts including recursion, abstraction, and interpreters. These exercises are part of my learning journey.

## 🛠️ Language

Solutions written in **Racket (Scheme dialect)**.
* I like to add that scheme  uses prefix notation, where the operators preceds the operands. Eg: a plus b can be written as + a b.
